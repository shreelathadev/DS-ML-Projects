## Project Summary

Completed a beginner-friendly data analysis workflow using Python and pandas on a CSV dataset of Amazon’s Top 50 Bestselling Books (2009–2019).

### What I did

- Explored the data (shape, columns, types, basic stats)
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset using DataFrame methods
- Exported the cleaned/modified dataset to a new CSV file

### Tools used

- pandas
- (optional) matplotlib / seaborn for visualizations

### Output
